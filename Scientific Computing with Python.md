# Python Basics

## Variables

**Definition:**  
A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You assign a value to something, pointing it out.

**Example:**
```python
age = 25
name = "Alex"
```

**Key Points:**
- Variables assign a name to a value
- Use the `=` operator to assign
- Variable names are case-sensitive
- Choose clear, descriptive names

## Strings

**Definition:**  
A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. It must be enclosed in matching quotation marks.

**Example:**
```python
text = "Hello World"
```

**Key Points:**
- Strings must start and end with the same quote type
- Use either single quotes ' ' or double quotes " "
- Mismatched quotes cause errors

## print() Function

**Definition:**  
The `print()` function is used to display output in the terminal. It is a built-in function that you can call to show results.

**Example:**
```python
# Calling the print function
print()
```

**Key Points:**
- print() outputs text to the console
- Functions are called using parentheses ()
- An empty print() call displays a blank line

## Function Arguments

**Definition:**  
An argument is the value or expression passed to a function when it is called. It goes inside the parentheses.

**Example:**
```python
greet = 'Hello!'
print(greet)  # 'greet' is the argument passed to print()
```

**Key Points:**
- Arguments are placed inside the function's parentheses ()
- You can pass variables (like greet) or direct values (like "Hello!")
- The function uses the argument to perform its task
